  <p>
    One night the thoughts of a bored Swedish chemist flies out the window to a
    search for his lost passion.
    With the understanding from his work, colleagues, wife and two children he
    goes to the land of coding.
    A land in the coffee room, bus stop, and mostly...a poorly ventilated scrub.
    Early mornings, introvert lunch breaks and afternoons dissolving in
    devotion, despair and hallelujah moments.
